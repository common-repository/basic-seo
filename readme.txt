Applies basic search engine optimisations to your WordPress powered site.

== Description ==

Applies the following simple search engine optimisations to your blog:

* Shows "Site Title" in page title always no matter what content your viewing
* Shows any content descriptor (page/post title etc.) first in page title
* Uses post excerpt as value of "description" meta tag
* Uses post tags as value of "keywords" meta tag
* Uses tag name as value of "keywords" meta tag when viewing posts for a tag
* Uses category name as value of "keywords" meta tag when viewing posts for a category
* Uses date as value of "keywords" meta tag when viewing posts for a date

That's it really, pretty simple stuff.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<?php wp_title(); ?>` inside the <title></title> tags in header.php for your template if not already there (should be the only content)
